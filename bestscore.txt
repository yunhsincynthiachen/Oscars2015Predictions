I think The Grand Budapest Hotel will win 4, maybe 5 #Oscars. Original Screenplay, Production Design, Costume, Makeup &amp; maybe Score.
If Interstellar doesn't win Best Original Score at the Oscars, I will rage
If Interstellar doesn't win Best Original Score on Sunday I will forever hate the Oscars
