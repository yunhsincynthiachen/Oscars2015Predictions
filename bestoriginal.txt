@BirdmanMovie or #GrandBudapestHotel? Who will screenplay? http://t.co/QZqjmiKHcU
Starting to think that Birdman will win Original Screenplay with Director &amp; Picture. #Oscars
@charlestrotter But Oscars will love Birdman way more than BAFTA did. Plus Birdman has a Globe Screenplay win.
The Imitation Game and The Grand Budapest Hotel won at the #WGAawards. Would it be safe to say that both will win Oscars for screenplay?
I think The Grand Budapest Hotel will win 4, maybe 5 #Oscars. Original Screenplay, Production Design, Costume, Makeup &amp; maybe Score.
