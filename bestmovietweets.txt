Oscars tomorrow! For 24 hrs I'll pretend Bradley will win bc he was outstanding in American Sniper, even though we all know it'll be Eddie
@StarplexCinemas I think American Sniper will win . What an all around fantastic movie ! #Oscars
What movie will win best picture at the Oscars? Will it be Boyhood? American Sniper?… http://t.co/eRne0elj6g http://t.co/0LP71ViLvF
@abytw "American Sniper” snuck in, to the surprise of many"

Seriously? 

One of the top grossing films of all time.

Doubt "American Sniper" will win Oscars. Just to many biased libtards in Hollywood.

@Rhettoric_1 Watch the "Imitation Game" if you haven't already. Excellent movie. Will win Oscars over "Birdman" and "Boyhood".
Reconsidering my #Oscars2015 #predictions:
Imitation Game will win something
Selma will win a couple of times
THE OSCARS ARE ALL POLITICAL!

The Imitation Game and The Grand Budapest Hotel won at the #WGAawards. Would it be safe to say that both will win Oscars for screenplay?

The tear gas smoke scene in Selma is equally as absurd as the sandstorm scene in American Sniper. Neither film will win Best Picture #Oscars
